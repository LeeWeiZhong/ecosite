            - Raise awareness on sustainable online brands. We want to let our users know
            which brands use eco-friendly packaging and which brands do not so that
            consumers will hopefully shop at those places with non-eco-friendly packaging
            less or just not buy from there altogether. At the same time, also encouraging
            them to buy from online businesses that use sustainable packaging and to show
            them that there are better sustainable choices in online shopping brands.

            - Educate users on what makes an online business sustainable. Recently, many
            people have been interested in starting their own big or small business. We want to
            let them know what type of packaging they can use that is sustainable and
            eco-friendly so that they will not use those that are unsustainable and cannot be
            recycled like non-recyclable paper and plastic.
        </p>

        <p class="general-text">
            We aim to aid the movement for sustainability and hope to help others to play a part too in becoming green and clean by buying from sustainable online brands that use eco-friendly packaging.
