                    Every minute you reload Shein, about 10 new items appear on your screen. That 
                    is because on average, Shein uploads over 5000 new items every day. Five 
                    thousand! That is 5000 types of garments being manufactured daily in sweatshops 
                    that pay low wages to workers. Nothing about Fast fashion brands are ethical 
                    nor sustainable at all, but it has managed to stick to us with its cheap prices 
                    and quick production of trendy clothing.

                    Viewing fast fashion through environmentally-friendly lenses, it adds to the fashion 
                    industry’s horrible reputation in being non-environmentally friendly, for fashion 
                    already is the world’s second most polluting industry as it is. Here are the big facts, 
                    and big numbers:

                “The fashion industry is currently responsible for more annual carbon emissions than 
                all international flights and maritime shipping combined.”
            </p>
    
            <p class="article-text">
                85% of most spare textiles get dumped. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="article-text">
                “The world consumes around 80 billion new pieces of clothing every year, 400% more 
                than the consumption twenty years ago.”
            </p>
    
            <p class="article-text">
                The numbers are astronomically high, and they aren’t slowing down the speed either. 
                Over the pandemic, fast fashion has become more of a trend due to online shopping 
                sites becoming very convenient to use. Online fashion giants are rising, targeting 
                Gen Zs now with marketing campaigns, one after another and sales are skyrocketing. 
                And the environment is facing the heat for it. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="article-text">
                Viewing fast fashion brands through an ethical eye, they are even worse. Sweatshops 
                function all around Asia, south asia and basically wherever they can exploit workers 
                from developing countries, for lower cost work. You spotted a dress for $10 only 
                only 3% of that price was used for production. And you could possibly expect even 
                lesser reach the workers. Workers, from underaged children to young women sit togeather 
                in cramped spaces tailoring away for hours on end to fit the fast fashion’s timeline 
                of “ 2 weeks from design to sales”.

            <p class="article-text">
                Fast fashion is a menace to developing countries. 
            </p>
    
            <p class="article-text">
                Fast fashion is neither environmentally friendly nor ethical, making it one of the 
                least sustainable industries to be working now. However, you can help, there is 
                limited ethical consumption under capitalism actually.
