                    Sustainability is the development/sourcing of goods, products and services to 
                    meet our current needs without compromising the ability of future generations 
                    to meet their needs. This takes into consideration that the natural resources 
                    around us are finite and important that we use such resources rationally. In 
                    addition, sustainability also extends to the workplace; ensuring that companies 
                    provide workers with appropriate working conditions, job quality, earnings and 
                    work-life balance.

                    With the current state of the world, we are unable to maintain the Earth’s 
                    ecosystems or to function as if, if sustainable choices are not made. The 
                    current usage of fossil fuels, overfishing and use of unsustainable materials 
                    in products for short-term profits will eventually lead to the collapse of 
                    the Earth’s environment and ecosystem without committing to sustainability. 
                    For the workplace, proper conditions are needed to ensure that workers are 
                    paid fair wages and not taken advantage of as well as to have safe working 
                    environments. This is to ensure the humane treatment of workers enabling more 
                    workers to stay in employment longer.

                As of now, one prevalent issue is the usage of environmentally unsustainable 
                materials in everyday products like clothing and plastic packaging. With the 
                rise of online purchases, the usage of such products has increased to match the 
                demand of the packaging.
