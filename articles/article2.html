                <p class="article-text">
                    Green buildings are buildings that are designed to be environmentally responsible 
                    and resource-efficient throughout the building’s lifecycle, from their planning 
                    to the design, the construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and lastly 
                    the demolition. As such, Singapore has plans to ensure that 80% of the total 
                    building gross floor area will be green by 2030. Singapore implemented the BCA 
                    Green Mark Scheme in January 2005 to promote efficient resource efficiency and 
                    reduce potential environmental impact in the build environment.

            <p class="article-text">
                Singapore has already promoted the use of public transport and encouraged active 
                mobility transportation like walking and cycling. Singapore has built on-top of 
                this by encouraging a shift to greener and cleaner vehicles like that of electric 
                cars. Singapore has implemented the Fuel Economy Labeling Scheme which provides 
                information on the fuel efficiency of each vehicle model and introduced a scheme 
                that provides rebates for low-emission vehicles and levies surcharges for high-emission 
                vehicles.

            <p class="article-text">
                Additionally, BlueSG, an electric car-sharing programme, was rolled out in 2017 which 
                introduces 1000 shared electric cars and 2000 electric charging stations all across the 
                country by 2020. There have also been plans for 50 hybrid buses to be deployed in the 
                first quarter of 2019 and 60 electric buses by mid-2020 for trials.

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Green Spaces</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                Singapore has planned to dedicate 10% of its land to be set aside for parks and nature 
                conservation. As such more than 80% of households live within 400 meters or ten minute 
                walk from their place of residence. This has been planned to be expanded to 90% of all 
                households by 2030 by creating more neighbourhood and regional parks.

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Encouraging the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse & Recycling)</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                Singapore, as a first world country, produces a large amount of waste and one area of 
                focus is the recycling of e-waste in the country. With faster product replacement 
                periods and turnover, the amount of electronic waste produced is set to increase 
                with the years. The government has partnered with some private companies to create 
                a network of collections centers that spans the entire country. Citizens are able to 
                visit these centres across the country to deposit their electronic waste which is 
                then given to licensed recycling centres. The government also plans to implement a 
                mandatory e-waste management framework to ensure that more of the current electronic 
                waste is reused instead of being thrown away.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text">
                One third of Singapore’s waste are made of packaging materials, as such to conserve 
                the resources that are being used to produce such plastics for packaging as well as 
                to reduce the total amount of waste placed into the landfills. As such the government 
                will make it mandatory for businesses to report on the type and the amount of packaging 
                they put on the market and their plans for reduction by 2021 and to have more engagement 
                with stakeholders and businesses to cut down on excessive use of plastic bags and 
                disposables.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text">
                Singapore’s households as well as the food industry also generates a large amount of 
                food waste. One example of this would be the waste generated from retail food 
                manufacturers  and supermarkets whose products may not fully sell and end up being 
                wasted due to the lack of sales. Such food is then thrown away, however, such businesses 
                can be encouraged to donate excess stock that is not easily sold to charities. Consumers 
                are also taught to be more cautious with their purchases via outreach initiatives as 
                well as to teach them more about being smart and prudent with food preparation and 
                storage habits.
