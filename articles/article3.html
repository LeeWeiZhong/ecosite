                    Sustainability is extremely important for the future of everyone on the planet, 
                    however, it is not only the responsibility of larger companies and governments, 
                    but also the contribution of everyone is important. Although it might seem that 
                    individual contribution will not amount to much, if everyone plays their part, 
                    the overall contribution to the global shift towards sustainability will be huge. 
                    Thus, it is important for people to play their part in leading more sustainable 
                    lives for the future generations.

                    Some small ways in which this can be done is by:

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Shopping for little but often.</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                A large portion of the waste that we generate is when we ‘over-buy’ groceries due to 
                large chain supermarkets having discounts or deals where they offer a lower price if 
                you were to buy more. However this leads to many people realizing that they are unable 
                to use up all the groceries that they have purchased which leads to wastage of the 
                products purchased as they usually are unused especially if you plan to eat out.
            </p>

            <p class="article-text">
                Instead, you should shop for the products that you know that you need and only for 
                that. This would help to cut down on the unnecessary purchases that are eventually 
                thrown away. In addition, it will help to cut down on costs as less products are 
                thrown away without being used. One way you can do this is by working through the 
                week and when you plan to use those products, for example on meals and to purchase 
                groceries based on what you are planning to make.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Planning ahead.</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                To add onto the previous point, you can purchase groceries that have bulk deals, 
                however, you should plan ahead and freeze them and use them at a later time. You 
                can make some meals like pasta sauce in bulk and freeze the remainder in serving 
                sized packets that can be used in later meals. This would not only allow you to 
                take advantage of discounts and sales but to also ensure that you do not waste any 
                of the food that you buy. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Minimize package</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                In Singapore, you should choose to purchase fruits and vegetables that come without 
                packaging like those at the markets instead of those at the supermarkets will reduce 
                the overall amount of plastic that you’ll consume. You can bring your own reusable 
                containers to places when ordering takeaway from those areas to reduce the usage of 
                disposable packaging. This is also applicable to places like hawker centers as it is 
                more commonplace to see people bringing their own takeaway for certain hawker centers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article-text-title">Recycle as much as you can</h3>

            <p class="article-text">
                Singapore has many different areas to recycle, as the government has ensured that 
                there are proper recycling bins for the different housing areas in Singapore, especially 
                those who live in HDBs. You can do your part by separating the trash that can be recycled 
                from those which cannot and throwing it into those designated bins for recycling.
