                    Sustainability is the development/sourcing of goods, products and services to meet our current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. This takes into consideration that the natural resources around us are finite and important that we use such resources rationally. In addition, sustainability also extends to the workplace; ensuring that companies provide workers with appropriate working conditions, job quality, earnings and work-life balance.

            With the current state of the world, we are unable to maintain the Earth’s ecosystems or to function as if, if sustainable choices are not made. The current usage of fossil fuels, overfishing and use of unsustainable materials in products for short-term profits will eventually lead to the collapse of the Earth’s environment and ecosystem without committing to sustainability. For the workplace, proper conditions are needed to ensure that workers are paid fair wages and not taken advantage of as well as to have safe working environments. This is to ensure the humane treatment of workers enabling more workers to stay in employment longer.

            As of now, one prevalent issue is the usage of environmentally unsustainable materials in everyday products like clothing and plastic packaging. With the rise of online purchases, the usage of such products has increased to match the demand of the packaging.
